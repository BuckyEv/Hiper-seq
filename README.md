# miRNA
The code section includes the main workflow and code for performing bioinformatics analysis in the study. 
The data section, on the other hand, consists of example data used specifically for these code sections. 
By using these codes in conjunction with the example data, it is possible to generate figures for the main text or supplementary material of the article.

Please note that this article repetitively uses a portion of the code for presenting different cell types. 
Here, we have only shown the plotting process for several important groups of images. For other images, as the plotting process is similar with only differences in cell types, they are not explicitly shown one by one.
